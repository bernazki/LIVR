problems that occur in data validation libraries\nProblem #1. Many validators check only those data for which the validation rules are described. \n\nIt is important for us that any user input that is not explicitly allowed is ignored. That is, the validator must cut out all data for which the validation rules are not described. This is simply a fundamental requirement.\n\nProblem #2. Procedural description of validation rules.\n\nWe do not want to think about the validation algorithm every time, we just want to describe declaratively how the correct data should look. In fact, we want to specify a data schema (why not \"JSON Schema\").\n\nProblem #3. Description of validation rules in the form of code. \n\nIt would seem that this is not so terrible, but this immediately nullifies all attempts to serialize the validation rules and use the same validation rules on the backend and frontend.\n\nProblem #4. Validation stops at the first field with an error.\n\nThis approach does not allow you to highlight all the error / required fields in the form.\n\nProblem #5. Non-standardized error messages.\n\nFor example, \"Field name is required\". I can not show such a mistake to the user for a number of reasons:\n\nThe field in the interface can be called quite differently\ninterface may not be in English\nyou need to distinguish between the type of error. For example, show errors on an empty value in a special way\n\nThat is, you need to return not an error message, but standardized error codes.\n\nProblem #6. Numerical error codes.\n\nIt's just inconvenient to use. I want the error codes to be intuitive. Agree that the error code \"REQUIRED\" is more understandable than the code \"27\". The logic is similar to working with exception classes.\n\nProblem #7. There is no way to check hierarchical data structures.\n\nToday, in the days of different JSON APIs, this can not be avoided. In addition to the validation of hierarchical data, it is necessary to provide and return error codes for each field.\n\nProblem #8. Limited rule set.\n\nThere are always not enough standard rules. The validator must be extensible and allow adding rules of any complexity to it.\n\nProblem #9. Too much responsibility.\n\nThe validator should not generate forms, should not generate code, should not do anything other than validation.\n\nProblem #10. Inability to perform additional data processing.\n\nAlmost always, where there is validation, there is a need for some additional (often preliminary) data processing: cut out prohibited characters, bring them to lowercase, remove unnecessary spaces. Especially important is the removal of spaces at the beginning and end of the line. In 99% of cases they are not needed there. I know that before that I said that the validator should not do anything except validation.\n\n"},"introduction/core-concepts.html":{"url":"introduction/core-concepts.html","title":"Core concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core concepts\nLIVR Specification\nSince the task was to make the validator independent of the programming language, a sort of mustache / handlebars, but only in the world of data validation, we started with the specification writing.\nPurpose of the specification:\n\nStandardize the data description format.\nDescribe the minimum set of validation rules that must be supported by each implementation.\nStandardize error codes.\nBe a single basic documentation for all implementations.\nHave a set of test data that allows you to verify the implementation for compliance with the specification\n\nThe specification is available in Documentation.\nThe basic idea was that the description of the validation rules should look like a data schema and be as similar to data as possible, only instead of the rule values.\nSee: Examples and Validation Rules.\nWhy not JSON Schema? \nFrequently Asked Question. Briefly, there are several reasons:\n\nA complex format for the rules. I want the structure with the rules to be as close as possible to the data structure. Try to describe this example on JSON Schema\nThe error format is not specified in any way and different implementations return errors in a different format.\nThere is no data conversion, for example \"to_lc\".\n\nJSON Schema contains interesting things, such as the ability to set the maximum number of items in the list, but in LIVR this is implemented simply by adding one more rule.\n"},"introduction/implementations.html":{"url":"introduction/implementations.html","title":"Implementations","keywords":"","body":"Existing implemenations\n\nJavaScript (LIVR 2.0) available at npm, maintainer @koorchik\nPerl (LIVR 2.0) available at CPAN, maintainer @koorchik\nPerl 6 (LIVR 2.0) available at CPAN, maintainer @koorchik\nPHP (LIVR 2.0) available at packagist, maintainer @WebbyLab\nPython (LIVR 2.0) available at pypi, maintainer @asholok\nOLIFER Erlang (LIVR 2.0), maintainer @Prots\nLIVER Erlang (LIVR 2.0), maintainer @erlangbureau\nJava (LIVR 2.0), maintainer @vlbaluk\nRuby (LIVR 2.0) available at rubygems, maintainer @fuksito\nRuby (LIVR 0.4, previous version) available at rubygems, maintainer @maktwin\nLua (LIVR 2.0), maintainer @fperrad\nGo (LIVR 2.0), maintainer @k33nice\n\nLatest LIVR version is 2.0\nPrevious LIVR version is 0.4\n"},"introduction/principles.html":{"url":"introduction/principles.html","title":"Principles","keywords":"","body":"Validator meets the following requirements:\n\nRules are declarative and language independent\nAny number of rules for each field\nValidator should return together errors for all fields\nExclude all fields that do not have validation rules described\nPossibility to validate complex hierarchical structures\nEasy to describe and understand validation\nReturns understandable error codes (neither error messages nor numeric codes)\nEasy to implement own rules (usually you will have several in every project)\nRules should be able to change results output (\"trim\", \"nested_object\", for example)\nMultipurpose (user input validation, configs validation, contracts programming etc)\nUnicode support\n\n"},"introduction/extensions.html":{"url":"introduction/extensions.html","title":"Extensions","keywords":"","body":"Extensions\nJavaScript\n\nlivr-extra-rules available at npm, maintainer @koorchik\n\n\nThe module contains extra rules for LIVR.

It can be function that builds validator or maybe just a validation function itself. Some arguments can be passed to the function - \"{ VALIDATION_RULE: ARGUMENTS }\". You may pass an array of validation rules. If you want to pass several arguments you should use array.\n\nExamples:\n'required' or {'required': [] } becomes:\n required();\n\n{ 'max_length': 5 } or { 'max_length': [5] } becomes:\nmax_length(5);\n\n{'length_between': [1,10] } becomes:\nlength_between(1,10);\n\n{'one_of': [['Kiev','Moscow']] } (this is old syntax) becomes:\none_of(['Kiev', 'Moscow']);\n\n{'one_of': ['Kiev','Moscow'] } (supported from v0.4)  becomes:\none_of('Kiev', 'Moscow');\n\n{'my_own_rule': [1, [2, 3], 'bla'] } becomes:\nmy_own_rule(1, [2, 3], 'bla');\n\nValidator receives value to validate and returns an error message(in case of failed validation) or empty string(in case of success). Thats all.\nSo, the idea is that there is a tiny core which can be easly extended with new rules.\n"},"validation-rules/types-coercing.html":{"url":"validation-rules/types-coercing.html","title":"Types coercing","keywords":"","body":"Types coercing\nYou should treat rules as expectations.  Therefore, all implementation make types coercing in numeric rules. This is reasonable because if someone says \"positive_integer\" then he expects to receive positive integer after validation.\nWe follow the same logic for string rules.  We compare values as string as rule are \"string rules\" but return what developer expects.  For example, if we use \"eq\" rule with input:\n{\n    field1: 1,\n    field2: 1\n}\n\nand rules:\n{\n    field1: {eq: \"1\"},\n    field2: {eq: 1},\n}\n\noutput will be:\n{\n    field1: \"1\",\n    field2: 1\n}\n\n(demo)\nWhat about the test suite? The test suite is stored in JSON format, therefore we can rely only on types that are supported by JSON. So, if we have input {field: \"1\"}, rules {field: 'positive_integer'} then the output will be { field: 1 }. As I see it should work. For example, JavaScript will coerce \"1\" to 1.

You have two ways: write custom rule 'valid_address' or assign rules to a variable and just reuse the variable. The first way requires much time and coding. Moreover, you cannot save new rule implementation is serialzed JSON file. The second way is much easier and you can store rule implemetation in JSON file but you cannot store user validation rules. Moreover, the second way does not allow you to redefine error code for address.\nFrom v0.4 you have the third way - rule aliasing.\nYou can register aliases for complex rules. The way how you register an alias depends on the implementation but the way how use and describe it is covered by the specification. This appoach allows you store aliases in serialized JSON files and then use them across different implementations.\n// Aliasing pseudo code\nvalidator.register_rule_alias({\n    name: 'valid_address',\n    rules: { nested_object: {\n        country: 'required',\n        city: 'required',\n        zip: 'positive_integer'\n    }}\n});\n\nvalidator.register_rule_alias( {\n    name: 'adult_age',\n    rules: [ 'positive_integer', { min_number: 18 } ]\n});\n\n// Usage\n{\n    name: 'required',\n    age: ['required', 'adult_age' ],\n    address: ['required', 'valid_address']\n}\n\nMoreover, you can add own error codes for the rules\nFor example\n// Aliasing pseudo code\nvalidator.register_rule_alias({\n    name: 'valid_address',\n    rules: { nested_object: {\n        country: 'required',\n        city: 'required',\n        zip: 'positive_integer'\n    }},\n    error: 'WRONG_ADDRESS'\n});\n\nand if validation of address fails you will have the next error\n{\n    address: 'WRONG_ADDRESS'\n}\n\n"},"how-to-contribute.html":{"url":"how-to-contribute.html","title":"How to contribute","keywords":"","body":"How to contribute\n\nCreate own Implementation\nCreate own Plugins\nImprove LIVR documentation (this site)\n\n"},"how-to-contribute/create-own-implementation.html":{"url":"how-to-contribute/create-own-implementation.html","title":"Create own Implementation","keywords":"","body":"Create own Implementation\nRequirements to implementation\n\nYour implementation should support all validation rules described in \"Validation Rules\"\nYour implementation should support \"Rules aliasing\"\nYour implementation should return error codes descibed in the specification\nIt should be easy to implement own rules\nPlease, use provided \"test_suite\" to ensure that your implementation works correctly\n\n"},"how-to-contribute/create-own-plugins.html":{"url":"how-to-contribute/create-own-plugins.html","title":"Create own Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Create own Plugins\nSee examples here.\n"},"how-to-contribute/improve-livr-documentation.html":{"url":"how-to-contribute/improve-livr-documentation.html","title":"Improve LIVR documentation (this site)","keywords":"","body":"Improve LIVR documentation (this site)\nSteps to be performed:\n\nFork: https://github.com/koorchik/LIVR\nnpm i -g gitbook-cli (see on GitHub)\ngitbook install gitbook/\ngitbook serve gitbook/\nopen localhost:4000/\nPull Request\n\n"},"changes.html":{"url":"changes.html","title":"Changes","keywords":"","body":"Changes\nv0.2\n\nAdded not_empty_list rule with test cases\n\nv0.3\n\nAdded filter rule \"trim\"\nAdded filter rule \"to_lc\"\nAdded filter rule \"to_uc\"\n\nv0.4\n\nAdded special rules (url, iso_date)\nAdded filter rules (remove, leave_only)\nAdd flags 'i' flag support to the \"like\" rule\nIntroduces new syntax for \"one_of\" and \"list_of\" rules.

The idea was that list of allowed values should be passed as array reference. So, {one_of: [['val1', 'val2']]} becomes one_of(['val1', 'val2']) but it is not always clear for users. Therefore, it was decided to introduce a new syntax. Now you can write {one_of: ['val1', 'val2']} that becomes one_of('val1', 'val2'). The main problem with it that you do not know how many arguments will be passed to 'one_of'. Moreover, you should support both syntaxes for backward compatibility (test suite contains tests for both cases). But it was decided that \"one_of\" and \"list_of\" rules can handle both syntaxes by themselves.\nTODO\n\nAdd JSON Schema comparison\nDescribe internals with detailed step-by-step example\nWrite developers guide\n\n"},"users.html":{"url":"users.html","title":"Users","keywords":"","body":"See who is using LIVR\nLogos are submitted by company and project representatives.
